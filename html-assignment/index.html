                I am a 37-year-old Colombian and I am a student in the first term of the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program at Algonquin College. I just started my classes and it is a challenge of which I would like to talk more in detail because I am very proud of it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an <em>Industrial Engineer</em> specializing in <em>project management</em> with over 14 years of experience working on projects in various sectors including: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technology</li>
                <li>Banking</li>
                <li>Construction</li>
                <li> <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Since May 20<sup>th</sup> 2019, I had been working full time as an <em>Executive Account Manager</em> at OmniPayments LLC, a US-based company that offers payments solutions, and I recently switched to part-time in order to join the college and follow my dreams.

                Becoming a graphic designer was my frustration for many years, so now I really enjoy the change that I have done for my life and for start doing something that I actually like. I am convinced that my hapiness will be reflected on my family's life and we will grow and learn all together from this process.

                Some of my hobbies are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Painting Clothes</li>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Dancing</li>
                <li>And of course, having fun with my daughter &#58;&#41;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I am extremely happy with the program I chose, I believe that It will give me a lot of knowledge and will allow me to venture into digital design and web development. To be honest, the Responsive Web Design subject made me feel a bit nervous but so far everything has gone well and I have enjoyed that little I have learned about HTML.
